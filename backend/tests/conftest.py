    Yields (TestClient, FakeChatGraph, FakeFirestore).

    Replaces the compiled LangGraph workflow (routes.chats.app) with a fake
    before the TestClient is built, so chat requests never touch a real
    ChromaDB collection, Ollama embedding call, or Gemini API call. Those
    are already stubbed at the module level by mock_modules, this replaces
    the graph's actual routing/retrieval/generation *logic* too, which is
    covered separately by tests/unit/test_graph_nodes.py.

    Also overrides the get_current_user auth dependency with a fixed USER
    profile, so tests that only care about chat behavior don't need to
    send a real Firebase ID token. Auth/role behavior itself is covered
    separately by tests/unit/test_core_security.py and
    tests/integration/test_routes_admin.py.

    core.chats and core.stats both get pointed at a single fresh
    FakeFirestore instance, so chats, their messages, and the resulting
    usage totals are all backed by the same in-memory store within a test.
